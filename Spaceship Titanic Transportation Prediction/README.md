#About the Dataset: 
If you're a new bee in machine learnnig or an expert, you must have heard or worked with the Titanic Dataset to start your machine learning journey. Well this Titanic dataset is collected from the year 2912 from an intersteller passenger liner called Spaceship Titanic. With 13000 people of on board and on its maiden voyage this spaceship was transporting immigrants from our solar system to three nearby habitable exoplanet orbiting the nearby stars. While rounding Alpha Centauri Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud and almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension. To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, we have to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceshipâ€™s damaged computer system. SOUNDS INTERESTING RIGHT?

#Personal Goal: 
As soon as i read the description about this competition I got excited immidiately and wanted to save all thsoe lost people from that Anomaly. Who doesn't wanna help rescue people from a sneaky space anomaly hidden in star dust. You could say my inner superhero woke up and wanted to help.

#Results:
After the cleaning the dataset and I used a stacking classifer which basically uses multiple classification estimators in this case and try to compute the results and use the strength of each individual estimator by using their output as input of a final estimator. And to figure out the best parameter for individual estimators, I have used grid search CV but the code for got deleted by mistake. In the end after preprocessing and building a model, I could get an accuracy of 79.78%.
