#About the Dataset: 
This NASA dataset is glimps about unlimited number of objects/astroids in the vast outer space. Even though some of them look very far but they are/might be closer than we think, their velocity, trajectory and direction no matter how far could prove hazardours to Earth and its people. Therefore it is very important to be aware about our surrounding and what could potentially by fatal or harzardous to us and hence dataset contains all those outer space objects which are classified as near earth objects and it is very clean as well.

#Personal Goal: 
I always been curious about the endless possibilties, the beauty and vastness of space and when i came across this dataset by NASA, I immediately knew that i wanted to work on it and see how i can understand and explore this data and build a model on top of it. 

#Results:
This dataset is very clean which saved me a lot of preprocessing time on it, except for two columns which had only one unique value and could have induced bias into my model if I did't get rid of them before buidling the model. And once I ran my Random Forest model after figuring out the best parameters, I could get 91% prediciton accuracy for my model. I have included the link to the dataset on kaggle and have uploded to my respository as well.

#Feedback: 
I am always looking forward towards a feedback on my work, do reach out if you think I could have done certain thing in a more efficient way and help me towards my journey to get better at machine learning exploration.
