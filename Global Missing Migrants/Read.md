# About the dataset - 
This dataset is about the Missing Migrants Project, a project run by the overseas Organization for Migration (IOM) since 2014, has compiled a comprehensive record of missing migrants and their sad travels towards overseas destinations. The dataset sheds insight on the difficulties faced by migrants during their travels by recording deaths and disappearances.

# Goal for the dataset -
Every year there are thousands of people around the world who migrate from one place to other, from one country to other, in search of maybe to study, to find jobs, better life, exploring worlds, or maybe just getting away from their country and what not. These people take different routes to travel and some of those might not be safe as others might be. And i wanted to explore the data and figure out the trends behind the global incidents regarding migrants. 

The dataset was taken from Kaggle and My work with interactive maps with this data is also available on kaggle on the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/rahul9116/migrant-incidents-eda-interactive-folium-map

# Results: 
The results showed me that, there are lot of incidents happen regarding migrants near US-Mexico border, whether they go missing, die trying to reach their destinations. While the incidents were decreasing gradually around the globe, until 2021 when it started increasing suddenly, which makes me wonder if those incidents are somehow related to the start of the pandemic, covid-19 but since I lack the data, I can not say for certain what might have caused the sudden spike in the cases concerning migrants all over the world.
