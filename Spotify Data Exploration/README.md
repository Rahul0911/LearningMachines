#About the Dataset: 
This dataset contains the list of most streamed songs in 2023 and contains a variety of features including but not limited to track's attributes, popularity on spotify and other platforms, release data and presence of key notes.

#Personal Goal: 
When i first saw the dataset, i got really curious about the data analysis i could do with it and wanted to figure out what are factors contributing towards a song streaming success on spotify being a big fan of spotify platform myself. I got to learn how a certain song properties can help it get streamed more on spotify compared to others, which keys are more popular than the others etc. When i was going through kaggle i came across a notebook that goes deeper into the analysis of key's role on a song's popularity (unfortunately, it comes with very less explanations, but data explorarion part is really good)and i have mentioned it below.

#Results: 
After the exploration and experimentation with the spotify data, I learned how a song being less lively is more popular on spotify and patterns abouts danceability and other factors contributes towards a streaming of a song on the platform. I have also compared the trends of song's popularity amoung differnt streaming platform as well.

#Feedback: 
I am always looking forward towards a feeback on my work, do reach out if you think I could have done certain thing in a more efficient way and help me towards my journey to get better at machine learning exploration.
